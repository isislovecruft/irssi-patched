How to submit a good bug report?

Send them to bug reporting system in http://bugs.irssi.org/

First you should give the following information:
 - irssi version, if CVS (or devel. tarball) then which day?
 - operating system / distribution and it's version
 - when did it crash? did you do something? can you reproduce the crash?

Getting backtrace of the crash also helps a lot, especially if irssi crashes
randomly. If after crash you see text:

 "segmentation fault (core dumped)"

It writes a file named "core" or "irssi.core" depending on your OS to
directory where you started irssi. If it doesn't print the "(core dumped)"
or you can't find the core file, you'll have to raise the limit for max.
core file size before running irssi. To do this, say:

 ulimit -c unlimited

So, if you have the core file and GNU debugger (gdb), you can get the
backtrace with:

 gdb irssi core
 set logging file bt.log
 set logging on
 bt
 set logging off
 quit

Provide the bt.log file.

Here's an example session:

[cras@hurina] ~/cvs/m/irssi/src/fe-text$ gdb ./irssi core
