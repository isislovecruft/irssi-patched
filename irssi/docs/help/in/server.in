/SERVER disconnects the server in active window and connects 
to the new one. It will take the same arguments as /CONNECT. 
If you prefix the address with the + character, Irssi won't 
disconnect the active server, and it will create a new window 
where the server is connected (ie. /window new hide;
/connect address)

/SERVER without any arguments displays the list of connected 
        servers.

/SERVER REMOVE <address> [<port>] [<network>]

/SERVER LIST

/SERVER PURGE [<target>] 

Clears the server send queue. Useful if, for example, you accidentally paste lots of text to a channel.
